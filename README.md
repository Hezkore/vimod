# VIModâš¡
VIMod _(VIM + Vemod)_ is my personal [Vim 9.0+](https://github.com/vim/vim) configuration.


VIMod is designed to complement any existing Vim setup, but works equally well on a fresh install! If you ever decide to remove VIMod, your Vim setup will return to its original state.

Learn more about VIMod on our [Wiki](https://github.com/Hezkore/vimod/wiki).

## Updating

### VIMod

If Git was used to clone the VIMod repository, you can update VIMod by running the following command in the VIMod directory:
```shell
git pull
```
Otherwise you can download the latest source code and extract it to the VIMod directory.

Remember to always run `:PlugInstall` after an update as plugins may have been changed.

### Plugins
To update all plugins, run the following command in Vim:
```vim
:PlugUpdate
```

## Uninstall
To uninstall VIMod, remove the runtime from your vimrc file and delete the VIMod directory.
