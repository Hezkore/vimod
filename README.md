# VIModâš¡
VIMod _(VIM + Vemod)_ is my personal [Vim 9.0+](https://github.com/vim/vim) configuration.

VIMod is designed to complement any existing Vim setup, but works equally well on a fresh Vim install!\
If you ever decide to remove VIMod, your Vim setup will return to its original state.

## Prerequisites
* Vim 9.0+ _(some plugins will not work with older versions)_
* A terminal size of at least 80 columns and 29 rows _(for the Quick UI to display correctly)_

GitHub Integration _(optional)_:
* [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

GitHub Copilot _(optional)_:
* GitHub [Copilot Subscription](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Troubleshooting
If you are unsure where your vimrc file is located, run the following command in Vim: `:echo $MYVIMRC`

If you are unsure if the runtime was added correctly,  run the following command in Vim: `:VIModVersion`\
If it says "Not an editor command: VIModVersion", the runtime was not added correctly.

VIMod will install and manage all plugins and dependencies automatically when you start Vim for the first time.\
The install screen will automatically close when the installation is complete, so just sit tight and wait for it to finish.\
If it is aborted, VIMod will not function correctly, and you will ned to run `:PlugInstall` manually.

Most errors are due to incorrect plugin installations, so if you encounter any issues, try running `:PlugInstall` and restarting Vim.

## Updating

### VIMod

If Git was used to clone the VIMod repository, you can update VIMod by running the following command in the VIMod directory:
```shell
git pull
```
Otherwise you can download the latest source code and extract it to the VIMod directory.

Remember to always run `:PlugInstall` after an update as plugins may have been changed.

### Plugins
To update all plugins, run the following command in Vim:
```vim
:PlugUpdate
```

## Uninstall
To uninstall VIMod, remove the runtime from your vimrc file and delete the VIMod directory.
